abstract = {Over the past decade, active control has been investigated in combustion systems as a means of preventing thermoacoustic instabilities from degrading the system performance. More recently, attempts to control instability and emissions as well as to satisfy other performance criteria have also been pursued. In this article, the authors review control problems in continuous combustion processes, the need for active control, and current status of the field. Despite the success reported in experimental investigations, a systematic procedure by which active control can be designed and implemented is currently not available. In particular, a theoretical framework which includes an investigation of the resonant nature of the thermoacoustic instability, an understanding of the significance of the mixing of modes and the dynamic impact of acoustic drivers, and the incorporation of the subtle coupling among the different physical processes of heat, mass, and momentum addition, as well as acoustics, turbulence, and chemistry, has not been developed. As an example of what can be accomplished using such a theoretically based approach, in this article the authors also review the results of their efforts expended thus far in the area of active control of a premixed combustor. The authors discuss the highlights of a feedback model proposed in Annaswamy et al. (1995) which captures the dominant dynamic features of the combustor. The authors demonstrate that their model captures the effects of several interacting modes, the mean-flow and mean-heat release in the combustor, and the locations of the actuator-sensor pair, and provides guidelines for an active control design. The authors suggest a systematic procedure for designing an active controller that provides an appropriate compensating action and results in improved performance},

abstract = {n the Lagrangian representation, the problem of advection of a passive marker particle by a prescribed flow defines a dynamical system. For two-dimensional incompressible flow this system is Hamiltonian and has just one degree of freedom. For unsteady flow the system is non-autonomous and one must in general expect to observe chaotic particle motion. These ideas are developed and subsequently corroborated through the study of a very simple model which provides an idealization of a stirred tank. In the model the fluid is assumed incompressible and inviscid and its motion wholly two-dimensional. The agitator is modelled as a point vortex, which, together with its image(s) in the bounding contour, provides a source of unsteady potential flow. The motion of a particle in this model device is computed numerically. It is shown that the deciding factor for integrable or chaotic particle motion is the nature of the motion of the agitator. With the agitator held at a fixed position, integrable marker motion ensues, and the model device does not stir very efficiently. If, on the other hand, the agitator is moved in such a way that the potential flow is unsteady, chaotic marker motion can be produced. This leads to efficient stirring. A certain case of the general model, for which the differential equations can be integrated for a finite time to produce an explicitly given, invertible, area-preserving mapping, is used for the calculations. The paper contains discussion of several issues that put this regime of chaotic advection in perspective relative to both the subject of turbulent advection and to recent work on critical points in the advection patterns of steady laminar flows. Extensions of the model, and the notion of chaotic advection, to more realistic flow situations are commented upon.},

abstract = {A material line consisting always of the same particles of fluid is lengthened by the con- vective action of turbulent motion, at a rate which is shown to be exponential at a sufficient time after the initial choice of the line. The area of material surface elements also increases exponentially, although with a different exponential coefficient. It is then a consequence of conservation of mass of the fluid that the normal distance between two neighbouring parallel material surfaces decreases at an exponential rate which is simply related to the rate at which material lines lengthen. These kinematical results are relevant to the convective action of the turbulence on the distribution of two kinds of local property of the fluid, viz. quantities, represented by 0, of which the total amount in a material volume of the fluid remains constant (e.g. mass density of a foreign substance), and quantities, represented by F, of which the total flux across a material surface remains constant (e.g. vorticity). F is proportional, at all times, to the vector representing a material line element and G, = VO, is proportional to the vector representing a material surface element, and hence they both increase exponentially in time. The last two sections of the paper are concerned with the combined effect on F and G of convection and molecular diffusion, and a condition for the effect of the convection to be dominant is obtained. In the case of F, convection is found to be dominant if the appropriate molecular diffusivity is small compared with the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, and F2 will then increase indefinitely, unless some additional effect comes into play (as it does in the case of magnetic field strength). In the case of G, convection will be dominant if the initial distribution of G has a large enough length scale; the effect of the convection is to decrease this length scale so that ultimately the two effects reach an equilibrium. The length scale of the ultimate distribution of G, as obtained herein, is different from that put forward recently by Obukhoff.},

abstract = {When some external agency imposes on a fluid large-scale variations of some dynamically passive, conserved, scalar quantity $\theta$ like temperature or concentration of solute, turbulent motion of the fluid generates small-scale variations of $\theta$. This paper describes a theoretical investigation of the form of the spectrum of $\theta$ at large wave-numbers, taking into account the two effects of convection with the fluid and molecular diffusion with diffusivity k. Hypotheses of the kind made by Kolmogoroff for the small-scale variations of velocity in a turbulent motion at high Reynolds number are assumed to apply also to small-scale variations of $\theta$. Previous contributions to the problem are reviewed. These have established that the spectrum of $\theta$ varies as  n{\^{}}{\{}- $\backslash$frac {\{}5{\}} {\{}3{\}}{\}} (n being wave-number) at the low wave-number end of the equilibrium range, but there has been some confusion about the wave-number marking the upper end of the range of validity of this relation. The existence of a conduction {\{}$\backslash$lq{\}}cut-$\backslash$noff{\{}$\backslash$rq{\}} near  n = $\backslash$isin{\{}$\backslash$sol{\}}k {\{}{\^{}}3{\}}) {\{}{\^{}}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}} as put forward by Obukhoff and Corrsin is shown to hold only when $\nu$ [double less-than sign] $\kappa$, and that near n = ($\epsilon$/$\nu$$\kappa$2)  {\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}} put forward by Batchelor is shown to apply only when $\nu$ [dbl greater-than sign] $\kappa$. In the case $\nu$ [double less-than sign] $\kappa$, the remaining problem is to determine the form of the spectrum of $\theta$ beyond the conduction cut-off; this is done in Part 2. In the case $\nu$ [dbl greater-than sign] $\kappa$, the conduction cut-off occurs at wave-numbers much higher than ($\epsilon$/$\nu$3) {\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}}, which is where the energy spectrum is cut off by viscosity, and where the spectrum of $\theta$ ceases to vary as  n{\^{}}{\{}- $\backslash$frac {\{}5{\}} {\{}3{\}}{\}}. The form of the spectrum of $\theta$ in this latter case is determined over the range n {\textgreater} ($\epsilon$/$\nu$3) {\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}} by analysing the effect of the velocity field, regarded as effectively a persistent uniform straining motion for these small-scale variations of $\theta$, and of molecular diffusion on a single Fourier component of $\theta$.$\backslash$nThe wave-number of this sinusoidal variation of $\theta$ is changed (and generally increased in magnitude) by the straining motion and the amplitude is diminished by diffusion. By supposing that the level of the spectrum of $\theta$ is kept steady at wave-numbers near ($\epsilon$/$\nu$3) {\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}} by some mechanism of transfer from lower wave-numbers, the linearity of the equation for $\theta$ then allows the determination of the spectrum for n {\textgreater} ($\epsilon$/$\nu$3)  {\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}}, the result being given by (4.8). The same result is obtained, using essentially the same approximation about the velocity field, from a different kind of analysis in terms of velocity and $\theta$ correlations. Finally, the relation between this work and Townsend's model of the small-scale variations of vorticity in a turbulent fluid is discussed.},

abstract = {Quantum phenomena of interest in connection with applications to computation and communication often involve generating specific transfers between eigenstates, and their linear superpositions. For some quantum systems, such as spin systems, the quantum evolution equation (the Schro{\&}{\#}x0308;dinger equation) is finite-dimensional and old results on controllability of systems defined on on Lie groups and quotient spaces provide most of what is needed insofar as controllability of non-dissipative systems is concerned. However, in an infinite-dimensional setting, controlling the evolution of quantum systems often presents difficulties, both conceptual and technical. In this paper we present a systematic approach to a class of such problems for which it is possible to avoid some of the technical issues. In particular, we analyze controllability for infinite-dimensional bilinear systems under assumptions that make controllability possible using trajectories lying in a nested family of pre-defined subspaces. This result, which we call the Finite Controllability Theorem, provides a set of sufficient conditions for controllability in an infinite-dimensional setting. We consider specific physical systems that are of interest for quantum computing, and provide insights into the types of quantum operations (gates) that may be developed.},

@article{Branicki2010,
abstract = {This report provides a topical review of transport in geophysical scale fluids. Rather than presenting an extensive synopsis of the literature, we attempt to connect some recent developments with an incisive 1948 paper by Eckart [1] in which three phases in the evolution of a tracer in turbulent flows were outlined and discussed. The interest here is on the intermediate or stirring phase, which is dominated by the fluid deformation rate. We relate Eckart's concept of stirring with recent efforts to identify ephemeral spatio-temporal channels that provide a template for transport in geophysical fluid flows. Heretofore such studies have been restricted to a few selected surfaces in the ocean or atmosphere. An application to a large ocean eddy in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates the methodology and shows that the eddy exchanges mass with its environment through material channels identified in the Lagrangian frame by finite-time dynamical systems techniques. We extend previous studies by determining the vertical extent of these transport pathways. The key finding is that the time-dependent geometric structures, which lead to formation of these pathways, retain their coherence well into the water column. Finally, we comment on the significance of these findings on parameterizations of transport processes in predictive models and on the life cycle of ocean mesoscale eddies. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In practice, many systems do not conform to either of these assumptions, so that calculations based on them may be inaccurate.

The use of the distribution-functions is illustrated by showing how they can be used to calculate the efficiencies of reactors and blenders. It is shown how models may be used to predict the distribution of residence-times in large systems.

abstract = {Key Words turbulence, entrainment, scalar dispersion, diffusion, reacting flow ■ Abstract The ability of turbulent flows to effectively mix entrained fluids to a molecular scale is a vital part of the dynamics of such flows, with wide-ranging consequences in nature and engineering. It is a considerable experimental, theoreti-cal, modeling, and computational challenge to capture and represent turbulent mixing which, for high Reynolds number (Re) flows, occurs across a spectrum of scales of considerable span. This consideration alone places high-Re mixing phenomena beyond the reach of direct simulation, especially in high Schmidt number fluids, such as water, in which species diffusion scales are one and a half orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest flow scales. The discussion below attempts to provide an overview of tur-bulent mixing; the attendant experimental, theoretical, and computational challenges; and suggests possible future directions for progress in this important field.},

We consider scalars maintained by temporally steady but spatially inhomogeneous sources, stirred by statistically homogeneous and isotropic incompressible flows including fully developed turbulence. The mixing efficiencies are rigorously bounded in terms of the Peclet number and specific quantitative features of the source. Scaling exponents for the bounds at high Peclet number depend on the spectrum of length scales in the source, indicating that molecular diffusion plays a more important quantitative role than that implied by classical eddy diffusion theories.},

abstract = {The mathematical framework for turbulent transport in the ocean is reasonably well established. It may be applied to large-scale fields of scalars in the ocean and to the instantaneous or continuous discharge from a point. The theory and its physical basis can also provide an interpretation of passive scalar spectra. Spatial variations in the rate of turbulent transfer can be related to the movement of the center of mass of a scalar and to a formulation in terms of entrainment. The relative dispersion of a scalar with respect to its center of mass and the streakiness of the concentration field within the relative dispersion domain need to be considered. In many of these problems it is valuable to think in terms of simple models for individual streaks, as well as overall statistical properties. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

As far as passive mixing is concerned, devices and techniques such as Y- and T-type flow-, multi-laminating-, split-and-recombine-, chaotic-, jet colliding-, recirculation flow-mixers and others are discussed. Active mixing can be accomplished by time-pulsing flow owing to a periodical change of pumping energy or electrical fields, acoustic fluid shaking, ultrasound, electrowetting-based droplet shaking, microstirrers, and others. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Experiments in coherent spectroscopy correspond to control of quantum mechanical ensembles guiding them from initial to final target states. The control inputs (pulse sequences) that accomplish these transformations should be designed to minimize the effects of relaxation and to optimize the sensitivity of the experiments. For example in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a question of fundamental importance is what is the maximum efficiency of coherence or polarization transfer between two spins in the presence of relaxation. Furthermore, what is the optimal pulse sequence which achieves this efficiency? In this paper, we give analytical answers to the above questions. Unexpected gains in sensitivity are reported for one of the most commonly used experimental building blocks in NMR spectroscopy. Surprisingly, in the case when longitudinal relaxation is small, the relaxation optimized pulse elements (ROPE) that transfer maximum polarization between coupled spins are longer than conventional sequences. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

The governing feature of this flow is the exchange between an interior space and the external ambient. Although the wind may often appear to be the dominant driving mechanism, in many circumstances temperature variations play a controlling feature on the ventilation since the directional buoyancy force has a large influence on the flow patterns within the space and on the nature of the exchange with the outside. Two forms of ventilation are discussed: mixing ventilation, in which the interior is at an approximately uniform temperature, and displacement ventilation, where there is strong internal stratification. The dynamics of these buoyancy-driven flows are considered, and the effects of wind on them are examined. The aim behind this work is to give designers rules and intuition on how air moves within a building; the research reveals a fascinating branch of fluid mechanics.},

abstract = {We study the statistics of a passive scalar T(x, t) governed by the advection-diffusion equation with variations in the scalar produced by a steady source. Two important statistical properties of the scalar are the variance, sigma(2) {\textless} T-2 {\textgreater}, and the entropy production, chi = kappa {\textless}vertical bar del T vertical bar(2){\textgreater}. Here {\textless}{\textgreater} denotes a space-time average and kappa is the molecular diffusivity of T. Using variational methods we show that the system must lie above a parabola in the (chi, sigma(2))-plane. The location of the bounding parabola depends on the structure of the velocity and the source. To test the bound, we consider a large-scale source and three two-dimensional model velocities: a uniform steady flow; a statistically homogeneous and isotropic flow characterized by an effective diffusivity; a time-periodic model of oscillating convection cells with chaotic Lagrangian trajectories. Analytic solution of the first example shows that the bound is sharp and realizable. Numerical simulation of the other examples shows that the statistics of T(x, t) lie close to the parabolic frontier in the (chi, sigma(2))-plane. Moreover in the homogenization limit, in which the largest scale in the velocity field is much less than the scale of the source, the results of the simulation limit to the bounding parabola.},

In this paper, we develop an algorithm for solving continuous-time optimal control problems for systems evolving on (noncompact) Lie groups. This algorithm generalizes the projection operator approach for trajectory optimization originally developed for systems on vector spaces. Notions for generalizing system theoretic tools such as Riccati equations and linear and quadratic system approximations are developed. In this development, the covariant derivative of a map between twoman- ifolds plays a key role in providing a chain rule for the required Lie group computations. An example optimal control problem on SO(3) is provided to highlight implementation details and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

The conflict, between the results$\backslash$nobtained in this paper and previous results which implied that the$\backslash$ninteraction increases the dispersion, is resolved. The ratio, of$\backslash$nthe contributions to the dispersion from the interaction term and$\backslash$nthe turbulent diffusion term, is obtained for comparatively large$\backslash$ntimes by the use of intuitive arguments, and is found to be inversely$\backslash$nproportional to the Prandtl number and a Reynolds number of the turbulence.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Mixing is relevant to many areas of science and engineering, including the pharmaceutical and food industries, oceanography, atmospheric sciences and civil engineering. In all these situations one goal is to quantify and often then to improve the degree of homogenization of a substance being stirred, referred to as a passive scalar or tracer. A classical measure of mixing is the variance of the concentration of the scalar, which is the L 2 norm of a mean-zero concentration field. Recently, other norms have been used to quantify mixing, in particular the mix-norm as well as negative Sobolev norms. These norms have the advantage that unlike variance they decay even in the absence of diffusion, and their decay corresponds to the flow being mixing in the sense of ergodic theory. General Sobolev norms weigh scalar gradients differently, and are known as multiscale norms for mixing. We review the applications of such norms to mixing and transport, and show how they can be used to optimize the stirring and mixing of a decaying passive scalar. We then review recent work on the less-studied case of a continuously replenished scalar field—the source–sink problem. In that case the flows that optimally reduce the norms are associated with transport rather than mixing: they push sources onto sinks, and vice versa.},

This allows an analytic understanding of the transition from a phase of constant scalar variance (for short times) to exponential decay (for long times). This transition is embodied in a short superexponential phase of decay. The asymptotic state in the exponential phase is an eigenfunction of the advection-diffusion operator, in which most of the scalar variance is concentrated at small scales, even though a large-scale mode sets the decay rate. The duration of the superexponential phase is proportional to the logarithm of the exponential decay rate; if the decay is slow enough then there is no superexponential phase at all.},

abstract = {We consider the questions of efficient mixing and un-mixing by incompressible flows which satisfy periodic, no-flow, or no-slip boundary conditions on a square. Under the uniform-in-time constraint {\$}\backslash|\backslashnabla u(\backslashcdot,t)\backslash|{\_}p\backslashleq 1{\$} we show that any function can be mixed to scale {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} in time {\$}O(|\backslashlog\backslashepsilon|{\^{}}{\{}1+\backslashnu{\_}p{\}}){\$}, with {\$}\backslashnu{\_}p=0{\$} for {\$}p{\textless}\backslashtfrac{\{}3+\backslashsqrt 5{\}}2{\$} and {\$}\backslashnu{\_}p\backslashleq \backslashtfrac 13{\$} for {\$}p\backslashgeq \backslashtfrac{\{}3+\backslashsqrt 5{\}}2{\$}. Known lower bounds show that this rate is optimal for {\$}p\backslashin(1,\backslashtfrac{\{}3+\backslashsqrt 5{\}}2){\$}. We also show that any set which is mixed to scale {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} but not much more than that can be un-mixed to a rectangle of the same area (up to a small error) in time {\$}O(|\backslashlog\backslashepsilon|{\^{}}{\{}2-1/p{\}}){\$}. Both results hold with scale-independent finite times if the constraint on the flow is changed to {\$}\backslash|u(\backslashcdot,t)\backslash|{\_}{\{}\backslashdot W{\^{}}{\{}s,p{\}}{\}}\backslashleq 1{\$} with some {\$}s{\textless}1{\$}. The constants in all our results are independent of the mixed functions and sets.},
