abstract = {Over the past decade, active control has been investigated in combustion systems as a means of preventing thermoacoustic instabilities from degrading the system performance. More recently, attempts to control instability and emissions as well as to satisfy other performance criteria have also been pursued. In this article, the authors review control problems in continuous combustion processes, the need for active control, and current status of the field. Despite the success reported in experimental investigations, a systematic procedure by which active control can be designed and implemented is currently not available. In particular, a theoretical framework which includes an investigation of the resonant nature of the thermoacoustic instability, an understanding of the significance of the mixing of modes and the dynamic impact of acoustic drivers, and the incorporation of the subtle coupling among the different physical processes of heat, mass, and momentum addition, as well as acoustics, turbulence, and chemistry, has not been developed. As an example of what can be accomplished using such a theoretically based approach, in this article the authors also review the results of their efforts expended thus far in the area of active control of a premixed combustor. The authors discuss the highlights of a feedback model proposed in Annaswamy et al. (1995) which captures the dominant dynamic features of the combustor. The authors demonstrate that their model captures the effects of several interacting modes, the mean-flow and mean-heat release in the combustor, and the locations of the actuator-sensor pair, and provides guidelines for an active control design. The authors suggest a systematic procedure for designing an active controller that provides an appropriate compensating action and results in improved performance},

abstract = {n the Lagrangian representation, the problem of advection of a passive marker particle by a prescribed flow defines a dynamical system. For two-dimensional incompressible flow this system is Hamiltonian and has just one degree of freedom. For unsteady flow the system is non-autonomous and one must in general expect to observe chaotic particle motion. These ideas are developed and subsequently corroborated through the study of a very simple model which provides an idealization of a stirred tank. In the model the fluid is assumed incompressible and inviscid and its motion wholly two-dimensional. The agitator is modelled as a point vortex, which, together with its image(s) in the bounding contour, provides a source of unsteady potential flow. The motion of a particle in this model device is computed numerically. It is shown that the deciding factor for integrable or chaotic particle motion is the nature of the motion of the agitator. With the agitator held at a fixed position, integrable marker motion ensues, and the model device does not stir very efficiently. If, on the other hand, the agitator is moved in such a way that the potential flow is unsteady, chaotic marker motion can be produced. This leads to efficient stirring. A certain case of the general model, for which the differential equations can be integrated for a finite time to produce an explicitly given, invertible, area-preserving mapping, is used for the calculations. The paper contains discussion of several issues that put this regime of chaotic advection in perspective relative to both the subject of turbulent advection and to recent work on critical points in the advection patterns of steady laminar flows. Extensions of the model, and the notion of chaotic advection, to more realistic flow situations are commented upon.},

We show that optimization problems in small system thermodynamics are solved by (deterministic) optimal transport, for which very efficient numerical methods have been developed, and of which there are applications in Cosmology, fluid mechanics, logistics, and many other fields. We show, in particular, that minimizing expected heat released or work done during a non-equilibrium transition in finite time is solved by Burgers equation of Cosmology and mass transport by the Burgers velocity field.

abstract = {We study advection-diffusion of a passive scalar, T, by an incompressible fluid in a closed vessel bounded by walls impermeable to the fluid. Variations in T are produced by prescribing a steady non-uniform distribution of T at the boundary. Because there is no flow through the walls, molecular diffusion, kappa, is essential in 'lifting' T off the boundary and into the interior where the velocity field acts to intensify delT. We prove that as kappa --{\textgreater} 0 (with the fluid velocity fixed) this diffusive lifting is a feeble source of scalar variance. Consequently the scalar dissipation rate chi - the volume integral of kappa$\backslash$delT$\backslash$(2) - vanishes in the limit kappa --{\textgreater} 0. Thus, in this particular closed-flow configuration, it is not possible to maintain a constant supply of scalar variance as K --{\textgreater} 0 and the fundamental premise of scaling theories for passive scalar cascades is violated.We also obtain a weaker bound on X when the transported field is a dynamically active scalar, such as temperature. This bound applies to the Rayleigh-Benard configuration in which T = +/-1 on two parallel plates at z = +/-h/2. In this case we show that chi less than or equal to 3.252 x (kappaepsilon/vh(2))(1/3) where v is the viscosity and E is the mechanical energy dissipation per unit mass. Thus, provided that epsilon and nu/kappa are non-zero in the limit kappa --{\textgreater} 0. chi might remain non-zero.},

We obtain an inequality, and the corresponding fluctuation theorem, generalizing the standard entropy production of stochastic thermodynamics. From this inequality we can derive an information processing entropy production, which gives the second law in the presence of information reservoirs. We also develop a systematic linear response theory for information processing machines. For an uni-cyclic machine powered by an information reservoir, the efficiency at maximum power can deviate from the standard value 1/2. For the case where energy is consumed to erase the tape, the efficiency at maximum erasure is found to be 1/2.},

abstract = {The relaxation of a smooth two-dimensional vortex to axisymmetry, also known as ‚Äòaxisymmetrization', is studied asymptotically and numerically. The vortex is perturbed at t=0 and differential rotation leads to the wind-up of vorticity fluctuations to form a spiral. It is shown that for infinite Reynolds number and in the linear approximation, the vorticity distribution tends to axisymmetry in a weak or coarse-grained sense: when the vorticity field is integrated against a smooth test function the result decays asymptotically as t‚àí$\lambda$ with $\lambda$=1+(n2+8)1/2, where n is the azimuthal wavenumber of the perturbation and n[gt-or-equal, slanted]1. The far-field stream function of the perturbation decays with the same exponent.

abstract = {A material line consisting always of the same particles of fluid is lengthened by the con- vective action of turbulent motion, at a rate which is shown to be exponential at a sufficient time after the initial choice of the line. The area of material surface elements also increases exponentially, although with a different exponential coefficient. It is then a consequence of conservation of mass of the fluid that the normal distance between two neighbouring parallel material surfaces decreases at an exponential rate which is simply related to the rate at which material lines lengthen. These kinematical results are relevant to the convective action of the turbulence on the distribution of two kinds of local property of the fluid, viz. quantities, represented by 0, of which the total amount in a material volume of the fluid remains constant (e.g. mass density of a foreign substance), and quantities, represented by F, of which the total flux across a material surface remains constant (e.g. vorticity). F is proportional, at all times, to the vector representing a material line element and G, = VO, is proportional to the vector representing a material surface element, and hence they both increase exponentially in time. The last two sections of the paper are concerned with the combined effect on F and G of convection and molecular diffusion, and a condition for the effect of the convection to be dominant is obtained. In the case of F, convection is found to be dominant if the appropriate molecular diffusivity is small compared with the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, and F2 will then increase indefinitely, unless some additional effect comes into play (as it does in the case of magnetic field strength). In the case of G, convection will be dominant if the initial distribution of G has a large enough length scale; the effect of the convection is to decrease this length scale so that ultimately the two effects reach an equilibrium. The length scale of the ultimate distribution of G, as obtained herein, is different from that put forward recently by Obukhoff.},

abstract = {When some external agency imposes on a fluid large-scale variations of some dynamically passive, conserved, scalar quantity $\theta$ like temperature or concentration of solute, turbulent motion of the fluid generates small-scale variations of $\theta$. This paper describes a theoretical investigation of the form of the spectrum of $\theta$ at large wave-numbers, taking into account the two effects of convection with the fluid and molecular diffusion with diffusivity k. Hypotheses of the kind made by Kolmogoroff for the small-scale variations of velocity in a turbulent motion at high Reynolds number are assumed to apply also to small-scale variations of $\theta$. Previous contributions to the problem are reviewed. These have established that the spectrum of $\theta$ varies as  n{\^{}}{\{}- $\backslash$frac {\{}5{\}} {\{}3{\}}{\}} (n being wave-number) at the low wave-number end of the equilibrium range, but there has been some confusion about the wave-number marking the upper end of the range of validity of this relation. The existence of a conduction {\{}$\backslash$lq{\}}cut-$\backslash$noff{\{}$\backslash$rq{\}} near  n = $\backslash$isin{\{}$\backslash$sol{\}}k {\{}{\^{}}3{\}}) {\{}{\^{}}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}} as put forward by Obukhoff and Corrsin is shown to hold only when $\nu$ [double less-than sign] $\kappa$, and that near n = ($\epsilon$/$\nu$$\kappa$2)  {\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}} put forward by Batchelor is shown to apply only when $\nu$ [dbl greater-than sign] $\kappa$. In the case $\nu$ [double less-than sign] $\kappa$, the remaining problem is to determine the form of the spectrum of $\theta$ beyond the conduction cut-off; this is done in Part 2. In the case $\nu$ [dbl greater-than sign] $\kappa$, the conduction cut-off occurs at wave-numbers much higher than ($\epsilon$/$\nu$3) {\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}}, which is where the energy spectrum is cut off by viscosity, and where the spectrum of $\theta$ ceases to vary as  n{\^{}}{\{}- $\backslash$frac {\{}5{\}} {\{}3{\}}{\}}. The form of the spectrum of $\theta$ in this latter case is determined over the range n {\textgreater} ($\epsilon$/$\nu$3) {\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}} by analysing the effect of the velocity field, regarded as effectively a persistent uniform straining motion for these small-scale variations of $\theta$, and of molecular diffusion on a single Fourier component of $\theta$.$\backslash$nThe wave-number of this sinusoidal variation of $\theta$ is changed (and generally increased in magnitude) by the straining motion and the amplitude is diminished by diffusion. By supposing that the level of the spectrum of $\theta$ is kept steady at wave-numbers near ($\epsilon$/$\nu$3) {\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}} by some mechanism of transfer from lower wave-numbers, the linearity of the equation for $\theta$ then allows the determination of the spectrum for n {\textgreater} ($\epsilon$/$\nu$3)  {\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$frac {\{}1{\}} {\{}4{\}}{\}}, the result being given by (4.8). The same result is obtained, using essentially the same approximation about the velocity field, from a different kind of analysis in terms of velocity and $\theta$ correlations. Finally, the relation between this work and Townsend's model of the small-scale variations of vorticity in a turbulent fluid is discussed.},

A computational model for generating them is therefore required. Here we present a Toy Model that provides a consistent framework in which generic properties of extensive chemical reaction networks can be explored in detail and that at the same time preserves the "look-and-feel" of chemistry: Molecules are represented as labeled graphs, i.e., by their structural formulas; their basic properties are derived by a caricature version of the Extended H{\"{u}}ckel MO theory that operates directly on the graphs; chemical reaction mechanisms are implemented as graph rewriting rules acting on the structural formulas; reactivities and selectivities are modeled by a variant of the Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory based on the Extended H{\"{u}}ckel scheme. The approach is illustrated for two types of reaction networks: Diels-Alder reactions and the formose reaction implicated in prebiotic sugar synthesis.},

@article{Bloch2010,
abstract = {Quantum phenomena of interest in connection with applications to computation and communication often involve generating specific transfers between eigenstates, and their linear superpositions. For some quantum systems, such as spin systems, the quantum evolution equation (the Schro{\&}{\#}x0308;dinger equation) is finite-dimensional and old results on controllability of systems defined on on Lie groups and quotient spaces provide most of what is needed insofar as controllability of non-dissipative systems is concerned. However, in an infinite-dimensional setting, controlling the evolution of quantum systems often presents difficulties, both conceptual and technical. In this paper we present a systematic approach to a class of such problems for which it is possible to avoid some of the technical issues. In particular, we analyze controllability for infinite-dimensional bilinear systems under assumptions that make controllability possible using trajectories lying in a nested family of pre-defined subspaces. This result, which we call the Finite Controllability Theorem, provides a set of sufficient conditions for controllability in an infinite-dimensional setting. We consider specific physical systems that are of interest for quantum computing, and provide insights into the types of quantum operations (gates) that may be developed.},

@article{Branicki2010,
abstract = {This report provides a topical review of transport in geophysical scale fluids. Rather than presenting an extensive synopsis of the literature, we attempt to connect some recent developments with an incisive 1948 paper by Eckart [1] in which three phases in the evolution of a tracer in turbulent flows were outlined and discussed. The interest here is on the intermediate or stirring phase, which is dominated by the fluid deformation rate. We relate Eckart's concept of stirring with recent efforts to identify ephemeral spatio-temporal channels that provide a template for transport in geophysical fluid flows. Heretofore such studies have been restricted to a few selected surfaces in the ocean or atmosphere. An application to a large ocean eddy in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates the methodology and shows that the eddy exchanges mass with its environment through material channels identified in the Lagrangian frame by finite-time dynamical systems techniques. We extend previous studies by determining the vertical extent of these transport pathways. The key finding is that the time-dependent geometric structures, which lead to formation of these pathways, retain their coherence well into the water column. Finally, we comment on the significance of these findings on parameterizations of transport processes in predictive models and on the life cycle of ocean mesoscale eddies. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The questions of importance in control have helped to revitalize certain problem areas in differential equations and methods and tools from control have been useful in obtaining new results in differential equation theory. On the other hand, going back to the era of Lie himself, there has been close ties between Lie theory and differential equations.

abstract = {The time evolution of a passive scalar advected by parallel shear flows is studied for a class of rapidly varying initial data Such situations are of practical importance in a wide range of applications from microfluidics to geophysics In these contexts, it is well-known that the long-time evolution of the tracer concentration is governed by Taylor's asymptotic theory of dispersion In contrast, we focus here on the evolution of the tracer at intermediate time scales We show how intermediate regimes can be identified before Taylor's, and in particular, how the Taylor regime can be delayed indefinitely by properly manufactured initial data A complete characterization of the sorting of these time scales and their associated spatial structures is presented These analytical predictions are compared with highly resolved numerical simulations Specifically, this comparison is carried out for the case of periodic variations in the streamwise direction on the short scale with envelope modulations on the long scales, and show how this structure can lead to "anomalously" diffusive transients in the evolution of the scalar onto the ultimate regime governed by Taylor dispersion Mathematically, the occurrence of these transients can be viewed as a competition in the asymptotic dominance between large Peclet (Pe) numbers and the long/short scale aspect ratios (L(Vel)/L(Tracer) equivalent to k), two independent nondimensional parameters of the problem We provide analytical predictions of the associated time scales by a modal analysis of the eigenvalue problem arising in the separation of variables of the governing advection-diffusion equation The anomalous time scale in the asymptotic limit of large k Pe is derived for the short scale periodic structure of the scalar s initial data, for both exactly solvable cases and in general with WKBJ analysis In particular, the exactly solvable sawtooth flow is especially important in that it provides a short cut to the exact solution to the eigenvalue problem for the physically relevant vanishing Neumann boundary conditions in linear-shear channel flow We show that the life of the corresponding modes at large Pe for this case is shorter than the ones arising from shear free zones in the fluid's interior A WKBJ study of the latter modes provides a longer intermediate time evolution This part of the analysis is technical, as the corresponding spectrum is dominated by asymptotically coalescing turning points in the limit of large Pe numbers When large scale initial data components are present, the transient regime of the WKBJ (anomalous) modes evolves into one governed by Taylor dispersion This is studied by a regular perturbation expansion of the spectrum in the small wavenumber regimes (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics [doi 10 1063/1 3491181]},

abstract = {We consider the issue of optimizing linear-regime nonequilibrium simulations to estimate free-energy differences. In particular, we focus on the problem of finding the best-possible driving function lambda(t) that, for a given thermodynamic path, simulation algorithm, and amount of computational effort, minimizes dissipation. From the fluctuation-dissipation theorem it follows that, in the linear-response regime, the dissipation is controlled by the magnitude and characteristic correlation time of the equilibrium fluctuations in the driving force. As a result, the problem of finding the optimal switching scheme involves the solution of a standard problem in variational calculus: the minimization of a functional with respect to the switching function. In practice, the minimization involves solving the associated Euler-Lagrange equation subject to a set of boundary conditions. As a demonstration we apply the approach to the simple, yet illustrative problem of computing the free-energy difference between two classical harmonic oscillators with very different characteristic frequencies.},

It is a considerable experimental, theoreti-cal, modeling, and computational challenge to capture and represent turbulent mixing which, for high Reynolds number (Re) flows, occurs across a spectrum of scales of considerable span. This consideration alone places high-Re mixing phenomena beyond the reach of direct simulation, especially in high Schmidt number fluids, such as water, in which species diffusion scales are one and a half orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest flow scales. The discussion below attempts to provide an overview of tur-bulent mixing; the attendant experimental, theoretical, and computational challenges; and suggests possible future directions for progress in this important field.},

abstract = {Evolution is one of the major omnipresent powers in the universe that has been studied for about two centuries. Recent scientific and technical developments make it possible to make the transition from passively understanding to actively mastering evolution. As of today, the only area where human experimenters can design and manipulate evolutionary processes in full is that of Evolutionary Computing, where evolutionary processes are carried out in a digital space, inside computers, in simulation. We argue that in the near future it will be possible to move evolutionary computing outside such imaginary spaces and make it physically embodied. In other words, we envision the "Evolution of Things", rather than just the evolution of code, leading to a new field of Embodied Artificial Evolution (EAE). The main objective of the present paper is to offer an umbrella term and vision in order to aid the development of this high potential research area. To this end, we introduce the notion of EAE, discuss a few examples and applications, and elaborate on the expected benefits as well as the grand challenges this developing field will have to address.},

@article{Evans2002,
abstract = {The question of how reversible microscopic equations of motion can lead to irreversible macroscopic behaviour has been one of the central issues in statistical mechanics for more than a century. The basic issues were known to Gibbs. Boltzmann conducted a very public debate with Loschmidt and others without a satisfactory resolution. In recent decades there has been no real change in the situation. In 1993 we discovered a relation, subsequently known as the Fluctuation Theorem (FT), which gives an analytical expression for the probability of observing Second Law violating dynamical fluctuations in thermostatted dissipative non-equilibrium systems. The relation was derived heuristically and applied to the special case of dissipative non-equilibrium systems subject to constant energy 'thermostatting'. These restrictions meant that the full importance of the Theorem was not immediately apparent. Within a few years, derivations of the Theorem were improved but it has only been in the last few of years that the generality of the Theorem has been appreciated. We now know that the Second Law of Thermodynamics can be derived assuming ergodicity at equilibrium, and causality. We take the assumption of causality to be axiomatic. It is causality which ultimately is responsible for breaking time reversal symmetry and which leads to the possibility of irreversible macroscopic behaviour. The Fluctuation Theorem does much more than merely prove that in large systems observed for long periods of time, the Second Law is overwhelmingly likely to be valid. The Fluctuation Theorem quantifies the probability of observing Second Law violations in small systems observed for a short time. Unlike the Boltzmann equation, the FT is completely consistent with Loschmidt's observation that for time reversible dynamics, every dynamical phase space trajectory and its conjugate time reversed 'anti-trajectory', are both solutions of the underlying equations of motion. Indeed the standard proofs of the FT explicitly consider conjugate pairs of phase space trajectories. Quantitative predictions made by the Fluctuation Theorem regarding the probability of Second Law violations have been confirmed experimentally, both using molecular dynamics computer simulation and very recently in laboratory experiments.},

abstract = {In this paper, we re-visit Gibbs' second (unresolved) paradox, namely the constancy of the fine-grained Gibbs entropy for autonomous Hamiltonian systems. We compare and contrast the different roles played by dissipation and entropy both at equilibrium where dissipation is identically zero and away from equilibrium where entropy cannot be defined and seems unnecessary in any case. Away from equilibrium dissipation is a powerful quantity that can always be defined and that appears as the central argument of numerous exact theorems: the fluctuation, relaxation, and dissipation theorems and the newly derived Clausius inequality.},

abstract = {While all organisms on Earth descend from a common ancestor, there is no consensus on whether the origin of this ancestral self-replicator was a one-off event or whether it was only the final survivor of multiple origins. Here we use the digital evolution system Avida to study the origin of self-replicating computer programs. By using a computational system, we avoid many of the uncertainties inherent in any biochemical system of self-replicators (while running the risk of ignoring a fundamental aspect of biochemistry). We generated the exhaustive set of minimal-genome self-replicators and analyzed the network structure of this fitness landscape. We further examined the evolvability of these self-replicators and found that the evolvability of a self-replicator is dependent on its genomic architecture. We studied the differential ability of replicators to take over the population when competed against each other (akin to a primordial-soup model of biogenesis) and found that the probability of a self-replicator out-competing the others is not uniform. Instead, progenitor (most-recent common ancestor) genotypes are clustered in a small region of the replicator space. Our results demonstrate how computational systems can be used as test systems for hypotheses concerning the origin of life.},

It may be applied to large-scale fields of scalars in the ocean and to the instantaneous or continuous discharge from a point. The theory and its physical basis can also provide an interpretation of passive scalar spectra. Spatial variations in the rate of turbulent transfer can be related to the movement of the center of mass of a scalar and to a formulation in terms of entrainment. The relative dispersion of a scalar with respect to its center of mass and the streakiness of the concentration field within the relative dispersion domain need to be considered. In many of these problems it is valuable to think in terms of simple models for individual streaks, as well as overall statistical properties. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Free-energy differences computed from fast-switching simulations or measurements according to the Jarzynski equation are independent of the particular protocol specifying how the control parameter is changed in time. In contrast, the average work carried out on the system as well the accuracy of the resulting free energy strongly depend on the protocol. Recently, Schmiedl and Seifert [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 108301 (2007)] found that protocols that minimize the average work for a given duration of the switching process have discrete steps at the beginning and the end. Here we determine numerically the protocols that minimize the statistical error in the free energy estimate and find that such minimum error protocols have similar discrete jumps. Our analysis shows that the reduction in computational effort achieved by the use of steplike protocols can be considerable. Such large savings of computing time, however, typically occur for parameter ranges in which an application of the Jarzynski equation is impractical due to large statistical errors arising from the exponential work average.},

Thus, nonequilibrium fluctuations are always more likely than what one would have expected from a linear response analysis.

As far as passive mixing is concerned, devices and techniques such as Y- and T-type flow-, multi-laminating-, split-and-recombine-, chaotic-, jet colliding-, recirculation flow-mixers and others are discussed. Active mixing can be accomplished by time-pulsing flow owing to a periodical change of pumping energy or electrical fields, acoustic fluid shaking, ultrasound, electrowetting-based droplet shaking, microstirrers, and others. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, the majority of nanorods are electromagnetically coupled to form a prominent red-shifted collective mode of localized surface plasmons resonant with the wavelength of the irradiated light, where a spectral broadening also appears for the efficient broadband optical response.

As we turn our attention to smaller systems, however, statistical fluctuations become more prominent. In recent years it has become apparent that the fluctuations of systems far from thermal equilibrium are not mere background noise, but satisfy strong, useful, and unexpected properties. In particular, a proper accounting of fluctuations allows us to rewrite familiar inequalities of macroscopic thermodynamics as equalities.

abstract = {The dispersion of passive scalars by the steady viscous flow through a twisted pipe is both a simple example of chaotic advection and an elaboration of Taylor's classic shear dispersion problem. In this article we study the statistics of the axial dispersion of both diffusive and perfect (non- diffusive) tracer in this system. For diffusive tracer chaotic advection assists molecular diffusion in transverse mixing and so diminishes the axial dispersion below that of integrable advection. As in many other studies of shear dispersion the axial distribution ultimately becomes Gaussian as t --{\textgreater} infinity. Thus there is a diffusive regime, but with an effective diffusivity that is enhanced above molecular values. In contrast to the classic case, the effective diffusivity is not necessarily inversely proportional to the molecular diffusivity. For instance, in the irregular regime the effective diffusivity is proportional to the logarithm of the molecular diffusivity. For perfect tracer chaotic advection does not result in a diffusive process, even in the irregular regime in which streamlines wander throughout the cross-section of the pipe. Instead the variance of the axial position is proportional to t ln t so that the measured diffusion coefficient diverges like ln t. This faster than linear growth of variance is attributed to the trapping of tracer for long times near the solid boundary, where the no-slip condition ensures that the fluid moves slowly. Analogous logarithmic effects associated with the no-slip condition are well known in the context of porous media. A simple argument, based on Lagrangian statistics and a local analysis of the trajectories near the pipe wall, is used to calculate the constants of proportionality before the logarithmic terms in both the large- and infinite-Peclet-number limits.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce optimal control algorithm for the design of pulse sequences in NMR spectroscopy. This methodology is used for designing pulse sequences that maximize the coherence transfer between coupled spins in a given specified time, minimize the relaxation effects in a given coherence transfer step or minimize the time required to produce a given unitary propagator, as desired. The application of these pulse engineering methods to design pulse sequences that are robust to experimentally important parameter variations, such as chemical shift dispersion or radiofrequency (rf) variations due to imperfections such as rf inhomogeneity is also explained. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Experiments in coherent spectroscopy correspond to control of quantum mechanical ensembles guiding them from initial to final target states. The control inputs (pulse sequences) that accomplish these transformations should be designed to minimize the effects of relaxation and to optimize the sensitivity of the experiments. For example in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a question of fundamental importance is what is the maximum efficiency of coherence or polarization transfer between two spins in the presence of relaxation. Furthermore, what is the optimal pulse sequence which achieves this efficiency? In this paper, we give analytical answers to the above questions. Unexpected gains in sensitivity are reported for one of the most commonly used experimental building blocks in NMR spectroscopy. Surprisingly, in the case when longitudinal relaxation is small, the relaxation optimized pulse elements (ROPE) that transfer maximum polarization between coupled spins are longer than conventional sequences. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {Non-traditional thermodynamics, applied to random behaviour associated with turbulence, mixing and competition, is reviewed and analysed. Competitive mixing represents a general framework for the study of generic properties of competitive systems and can be used to model a wide class of non-equilibrium phenomena ranging from turbulent premixed flames and invasion waves to complex competitive systems. We demonstrate consistency of the general principles of competition with thermodynamic description, review and analyse the related entropy concepts and introduce the corresponding competitive H-theorem. A competitive system can be characterised by a thermodynamic quantity - competitive potential --- which determines the likely direction of evolution of the system. Contested resources tend to move between systems from lower to higher values of the competitive potential. There is, however, an important difference between conventional thermodynamics and competitive thermodynamics. While conventional thermodynamics is constrained by its zeroth law and is fundamentally transitive, the transitivity of competitive thermodynamics depends on the transitivity of the competition rules. Intransitivities are common in the real world and are responsible for complex behaviour in competitive systems. This work follows the ideas and methods that are originated in analysis of turbulent combustion but reviews a much broader scope of issues linked to mixing and competition, including thermodynamic characterisation of complex competitive systems with self-organisation. The approach presented here is interdisciplinary and is addressed to a general educated reader, while the mathematical details can be found in the Appendices.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein‚àíprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ‚â§ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Natural ventilation of buildings is the flow generated by temperature differences and by the wind. The governing feature of this flow is the exchange between an interior space and the external ambient. Although the wind may often appear to be the dominant driving mechanism, in many circumstances temperature variations play a controlling feature on the ventilation since the directional buoyancy force has a large influence on the flow patterns within the space and on the nature of the exchange with the outside. Two forms of ventilation are discussed: mixing ventilation, in which the interior is at an approximately uniform temperature, and displacement ventilation, where there is strong internal stratification. The dynamics of these buoyancy-driven flows are considered, and the effects of wind on them are examined. The aim behind this work is to give designers rules and intuition on how air moves within a building; the research reveals a fascinating branch of fluid mechanics.},

abstract = {Since about a decade various fluctuation relations for the entropy production have been derived and analyzed. These relations deal with symmetries of the entropy production under time-reversal and have been proposed as a non-perturbative generalization of fluctuation‚Äîdissipation relations. I describe a unifying framework for understanding these relations and I present an algorithm to derive them. The fluctuation relations all follow from the main observation that in great generality the path-dependent entropy production is the source-term of time-reversal breaking in the Lagrangian over space-time histories. That is illustrated via a number of examples as well as via a general theoretical argument. I move these relations away from the strict dynamical background in which they originated and take them back to the context of statistical mechanics where entropy is understood in the sense of Boltzmann, as measuring the typicality of a manifest condition. I discuss how a relation between work and free energy is naturally put in that framework and how the transient and steady state fluctuation theorems are simple consequences. The fact that fluctuation symmetries for the entropy production are in general only valid asymptotically for large times, makes them mostly inaccessible for experimental verification, in contrast with a recent claim that they would usefully quantify second law violations. Part of the interest in the resulting fluctuation symmetries is that they are so universally valid, a rare occasion in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. However they do not provide a systematic perturbation expansion for response functions. For that one needs to go back to the full Lagrangian and also consider the nonequilibrium modifications to its time-symmetric part.},

abstract = {Several implications of well-known fluctuation theorems, on the statistical properties of entropy production, are studied using various approaches. We begin by deriving a tight lower bound on the variance of the entropy production for a given mean of this random variable. It is shown that the Evans‚ÄìSearles fluctuation theorem alone imposes a significant lower bound on the variance only when the mean entropy production is very small. It is then nonetheless demonstrated that upon incorporating additional information concerning the entropy production, this lower bound can be significantly improved, so as to capture extensivity properties. Another important aspect of the fluctuation properties of the entropy production is the relationship between the mean and the variance, on the one hand, and the probability of the event where the entropy production is negative, on the other hand. Accordingly, we derive upper and lower bounds on this probability in terms of the mean and the variance. These bounds are tighter than previous bounds that can be found in the literature. Moreover, they are tight in the sense that there exist probability distributions, satisfying the Evans‚ÄìSearles fluctuation theorem, that achieve them with equality. Finally, we present a general method for generating a wide class of inequalities that must be satisfied by the entropy production. We use this method to derive several new inequalities that go beyond the standard derivation of the second law.},

abstract = {Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the Navier Stokes equations is an invaluable research tool in fluid dynamics. Still, there are few publicly available research codes and, due to the heavy number crunching implied, available codes are usually written in low-level languages such as C/C++ or Fortran. In this paper we describe a pure scientific Python pseudo-spectral DNS code that nearly matches the performance of C++ for thousands of processors and billions of unknowns. We also describe a version optimized through Cython, that is found to match the speed of C++. The solvers are written from scratch in Python, both the mesh, the MPI domain decomposition, and the temporal integrators. The solvers have been verified and benchmarked on the Shaheen supercomputer at the KAUST supercomputing laboratory, and we are able to show very good scaling up to several thousand cores. A very important part of the implementation is the mesh decomposition (we implement both slab and pencil decompositions) and 3D parallel Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). The mesh decomposition and FFT routines have been implemented in Python using serial FFT routines (either NumPy, pyFFTW or any other serial FFT module), NumPy array manipulations and with MPI communications handled by MPI for Python (mpi4py). We show how we are able to execute a 3D parallel FFT in Python for a slab mesh decomposition using 4 lines of compact Python code, for which the parallel performance on Shaheen is found to be slightly better than similar routines provided through the FFTW library. For a pencil mesh decomposition 7 lines of code is required to execute a transform.},

Efficient design requires understanding how nanomachines can operate at minimal energy dissipation. In this letter we focus on mechanical systems controlled by smoothly varying potential forces. We show that optimal control equations come about in a natural way if the energy cost to manipulate the potential is taken into account. When such cost becomes negligible, the optimal control strategy can be constructed by transparent geometrical methods and recovers the solution of optimal mass transport equations in the overdamped limit. Our equations are equivalent to hierarchies of kinetic equations of a form well-known in the theory of dilute gases.

It is possible that artificial evolution and situated self-organizing agents could become viable tools for studying machine consciousness, but there are several issues that must be overcome. One problem is the use of exogenous selection methods to drive artificial evolutionary processes. A second problem relates to agent representation that is inconsistent with the environment in which the agents are situated. These issues limit the potential for open-ended evolution and fine-grained fitting of agents to environment, which are likely to be important for the eventual development of situated artificial consciousness.},

@article{Osserman1978,
abstract = {The problem, which closed plane curve of given length encloses the largest area, was already known in antiquity, with its solution the circle. According to legend, the Phoenician princess Dido founded the city of Carthago on a piece of land obtained from the local king. As she got only as much land as could be encompassed by an oxhide, she let the hide be cut into thin strips, so that she had enough to encircle an entire hill nearby. A satisfactory proof that the solution is a circle was rst obtained in the 19th century. The famous geometer Jacob Steiner give a proof, based on geometric constructions, which starting from a curve, dierent from a circle, leads to a curve with the same length, but enclosing a strictly larger area. Dirichlet, his colleague in Berlin, tried without success to convince him that this does not suce as proof, without showing the existence of a solution. Many proofs are now known. The one below goes back to Hurwitz. The analytic part can be isolated in the following lemma. Wirtinger's inequality. Let f (t) be a piecewise smooth, continuous 2$\pi$-periodic function with mean value 0, i.e., 2$\pi$ 0 f (t)dt = 0. Then 2$\pi$ 0 (f) 2 dt ‚â• 2$\pi$ 0 f 2 dt , with equality if and only if f (t) = a cos t + b sin t, where a and b are constants. The condition for equality can also be stated as f (t) = a cos(t + b), where a and b are (new) constants; this follows from the addition formulas for sine and cosine. Using Wirtinger's inequality we can give a simple proof of the isoperimetric inequality. Theorem. Let $\gamma$ be a simple closed curve with length l, enclosing an area A. Then l 2 ‚â• 4$\pi$A with equality if and only if $\gamma$ is a circle. Proof. We parametrise $\gamma$ with constant speed l/2$\pi$. By a translation we may assume that 2$\pi$ 0 x(t)dt = 0. Now l 2 /2$\pi$ = 2$\pi$ 0 (t) 2 dt = 2$\pi$ 0 (x) 2 + (y) 2 dt. We compute the area with Green's theorem to be A = int($\gamma$) dxdy = 2$\pi$ 0 xy dt. This gives us l 2 ‚àí 4$\pi$A = 2$\pi$ 2$\pi$ 0 (x) 2 + (y) 2 ‚àí 2xy dt = 2$\pi$ 2$\pi$ 0 (x) 2 ‚àí x 2 dt + 2$\pi$ 2$\pi$ 0 (y ‚àí x) 2 dt ‚â• 0 , 1 where the rst integral is non-negative by Wirtinger's inequality for the function x(t), and the integrand of the second is non-negative. Equality holds if and only if x(t) = a cos(t + b) and y = x, so y(t) = a sin(t + b) + c. Because},

abstract = {We consider a model for phase separation in binary viscous liquids that allows for material transport due to cross-diffusion of unlike particles and convection by the hydrodynamic bulk flow. Typically, during the evolution, the average size of domains of the pure phases increases with time - a phenomenon called coarsening. Siggia [Eric D. Siggia, Phys. Rev. A, 20(2), 595-605, Aug. 1979] predicts that at an initial stage, coarsening proceeds mainly by diffusion, which leads to the well-known evaporation-recondensation growth law ‚Ñì{\~{}}t1/3, when ‚Ñì denotes the average domains size and t denotes time. Furthermore, he argued that at a later stage, convection by the bulk flow becomes the dominant transport mechanism, leading to a crossover in the coarsening rates to ‚Ñì{\~{}}t. Siggia's predictions have been confirmed by experiments and numerical simulations. In this work, we prove the crossover in the coarsening rates in terms of time-averaged lower bounds on the energy, which scales like an inverse length. We use a method proposed by Kohn and the first author [Robert V. Kohn and Felix Otto, Commun. Math. Phys., 229(3), 375-395, 2002], which exploits the gradient flow structure of the dynamics. Our adaption uses techniques from optimal transportation. Our main ingredient is a dissipation inequality. It measures how the optimal transportation distance changes under the effects of convective and diffusive transport. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Press.},

abstract = {All living things exhibit adaptations that enable them to survive and reproduce in the natural environment that they inhabit. From a biological standpoint, it has long been understood that adaptation comes from natural selection, whereby maladapted individuals do not pass their traits effectively to future generations. However, we may also consider the phenomenon of adaptation from the standpoint of physics, and ask whether it is possible to delineate what the difference is in terms of physical properties between something that is well-adapted to its surrounding environment, and something that is not. In this work, we undertake to address this question from a theoretical standpoint. Building on past fundamental results in far-from-equilibrium statistical mechanics, we demonstrate a generalization of the Helmholtz free energy for the finite-time stochastic evolution of driven Newtonian matter. By analyzing this expression term by term, we are able to argue for a general tendency in driven many-particle systems towards self-organization into states formed through exceptionally reliable absorption and dissipation of work energy from the surrounding environment. Subsequently, we illustrate the mechanism of this general tendency towards physical adaptation by analyzing the process of random hopping in driven energy landscapes.},

Two important statistical properties of the scalar are the variance, sigma(2) {\textless} T-2 {\textgreater}, and the entropy production, chi = kappa {\textless}vertical bar del T vertical bar(2){\textgreater}. Here {\textless}{\textgreater} denotes a space-time average and kappa is the molecular diffusivity of T. Using variational methods we show that the system must lie above a parabola in the (chi, sigma(2))-plane. The location of the bounding parabola depends on the structure of the velocity and the source. To test the bound, we consider a large-scale source and three two-dimensional model velocities: a uniform steady flow; a statistically homogeneous and isotropic flow characterized by an effective diffusivity; a time-periodic model of oscillating convection cells with chaotic Lagrangian trajectories. Analytic solution of the first example shows that the bound is sharp and realizable. Numerical simulation of the other examples shows that the statistics of T(x, t) lie close to the parabolic frontier in the (chi, sigma(2))-plane. Moreover in the homogenization limit, in which the largest scale in the velocity field is much less than the scale of the source, the results of the simulation limit to the bounding parabola.},

It is shown that nonequilibrium may become a source of order and that irreversible processes may lead to a new type of dynamic states of matter called "dissipative structures." The thermodynamic theory of such structures is outlined. A microscopic definition of irreversible processes is given, and a transformation theory is developed that allows one to introduce nonunitary equations of motion that explicitly display irreversibility and approach to thermodynamic equilibrium. The work of the group at the University of Brussels in these fields is briefly reviewed.

abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

They describe the statistical fluctuations in time-averaged properties of many-particle systems such as fluids driven to nonequilibrium states and provide some of the few analytical expressions that describe nonequilibrium states. Quantitative predictions on fluctuations in small systems that are monitored over short periods can also be made, and therefore the fluctuation theorems allow thermodynamic con-cepts to be extended to apply to finite systems. For this reason, we anticipate an important role for fluctuation theorems in the design of nanotechnological devices and in the understanding of biologi-cal processes. This review discusses these theorems, their physical significance, and results for experimental and model systems.

abstract = {The mixing efficiency of a flow advecting a passive scalar sustained by steady sources and sinks is naturally defined in terms of the suppression of bulk scalar variance in the presence of stirring, relative to the variance in the absence of stirring. These variances can be weighted at various spatial scales, leading to a family of multi-scale mixing measures and efficiencies. We derive a priori estimates on these efficiencies from the advection-diffusion partial differential equation, focusing on a broad class of statistically homogeneous and isotropic incompressible flows. The analysis produces bounds on the mixing efficiencies in terms of the P??clet number, a measure of the strength of the stirring relative to molecular diffusion. We show by example that the estimates are sharp for particular source, sink and flow combinations. In general the high-P??clet-number behavior of the bounds (scaling exponents as well as prefactors) depends on the structure and smoothness properties of, and length scales in, the scalar source and sink distribution. The fundamental model of the stirring of a monochromatic source/sink combination by the random sine flow is investigated in detail via direct numerical simulation and analysis. The large-scale mixing efficiency follows the upper bound scaling (within a logarithm) at high P??clet number but the intermediate and small-scale efficiencies are qualitatively less than optimal. The P??clet number scaling exponents of the efficiencies observed in the simulations are deduced theoretically from the asymptotic solution of an internal layer problem arising in a quasi-static model. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The advection of a passive substance by a turbulent flow is important in many natural and engineering settings. The concentration of such a substance can exhibit complex dynamic behaviour that shows many phenomenological parallels with the behaviour of the turbulent velocity field. Yet the statistical properties of this so-called 'passive scalar' turbulence are decoupled from those of the underlying velocity field. Passive scalar turbulence has recently yielded to mathematical analysis, and such progress may ultimately lead to a better understanding of the still intractable problem of fluid turbulence itself.},

The system's state retains information about past environmental fluctuations, and a fraction of this information is predictive of future ones. The remaining nonpredictive information reflects model complexity that does not improve predictive power, and thus represents the ineffectiveness of the model. We expose the fundamental equivalence between this model inefficiency and thermodynamic inefficiency, measured by dissipation. Our results hold arbitrarily far from thermodynamic equilibrium and are applicable to a wide range of systems, including biomolecular machines. They highlight a profound connection between the effective use of information and efficient thermodynamic operation: any system constructed to keep memory about its environment and to operate with maximal energetic efficiency has to be predictive.},

abstract = {Mixing is relevant to many areas of science and engineering, including the pharmaceutical and food industries, oceanography, atmospheric sciences and civil engineering. In all these situations one goal is to quantify and often then to improve the degree of homogenization of a substance being stirred, referred to as a passive scalar or tracer. A classical measure of mixing is the variance of the concentration of the scalar, which is the L 2 norm of a mean-zero concentration field. Recently, other norms have been used to quantify mixing, in particular the mix-norm as well as negative Sobolev norms. These norms have the advantage that unlike variance they decay even in the absence of diffusion, and their decay corresponds to the flow being mixing in the sense of ergodic theory. General Sobolev norms weigh scalar gradients differently, and are known as multiscale norms for mixing. We review the applications of such norms to mixing and transport, and show how they can be used to optimize the stirring and mixing of a decaying passive scalar. We then review recent work on the less-studied case of a continuously replenished scalar field‚Äîthe source‚Äìsink problem. In that case the flows that optimally reduce the norms are associated with transport rather than mixing: they push sources onto sinks, and vice versa.},

This allows an analytic understanding of the transition from a phase of constant scalar variance (for short times) to exponential decay (for long times). This transition is embodied in a short superexponential phase of decay. The asymptotic state in the exponential phase is an eigenfunction of the advection-diffusion operator, in which most of the scalar variance is concentrated at small scales, even though a large-scale mode sets the decay rate. The duration of the superexponential phase is proportional to the logarithm of the exponential decay rate; if the decay is slow enough then there is no superexponential phase at all.},

abstract = {Values of rate of decay and mean life of atoms and molecules in upper quantum states calculated from data on the intensity of absorption lines.-By combining F{\"{u}}chtbauer's method of determining from the intensity of absorption lines the probability that a molecule will absorb a quantum of energy, with Einstein's views as to the mechanism of light absorption and emission, the following equation is derived for calculating the rate at which molecules jump from upper to lower quantum states: A21=8$\pi$$\nu$2c2N1p1p2$\alpha$d$\nu$ where A21 is the chance per unit time that a molecule will jump spontaneously from quantum state 2 to quantum state 1, $\nu$ is the frequency of the light emitted in such a jump, p1 and p2 are the a priori probabilities of quantum states 1 and 2, and $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient of the substance measured under conditions such that N1 is the number of molecules per unit volume in the lower quantum state 1. The integral ;$\alpha$d$\nu$ is to be taken over the total effective width of the absorption line corresponding to the passage of molecules from quantum state 1 to quantum state 2. The mean life $\tau$ of molecules which decay from state 2 to state 1 is the reciprocal of A21. Values of A21 and $\tau$ are calculated from existing data for the mercury line $\lambda$2537, for a number of lines belonging to the alkali doublets, for the iodine line $\lambda$5461, and for a very considerable number of lines belonging to the rotation-oscillation spectra of the hydrogen halides. The values obtained agree with the meager data made available by other experimental methods. From these results the following conclusions are drawn. The mean life of molecules and atoms in upper quantum states may vary for different states at least over the range 1 to 10-8 seconds. The rate of decay is not a simple function of the frequency of the emitted light. The rate corresponding to the emission of a line of high frequency may be greater or less than that for a line of lower frequency. The data now available for the alkali doublets 1s-mp1 and 1s-mp2 indicate a higher rate of decay the smaller the change in total quantum number for the line under consideration. The rate of decay from a given mp1 state is m times as great as from the corresponding mp2 state (already stated in another form by F{\"{u}}chtbauer and Hofmann). In the case of the rotation-oscillation spectra of the hydrogen halides the rate of decay is greater for quantum states with one unit of oscillation and many of rotation, than for those with one unit of oscillation and only a few of rotation; and in the case of different molecules but the same quantum numbers the rate of decay is greater for the molecule with the greater frequency of oscillation. Finally the possibility and method of calculating absolute values of A21 from the Bohr correspondence principle is indicated. {\textcopyright} 1924 The American Physical Society.},

The descriptions show that the present approach has good modularity and scalability that will be useful for modeling a huge network of pathways. Moreover, we give a procedure to perform reasoning in the artificial chemistry, which checks whether a specified collection of molecules can be generated in a given model, and we demonstrate that it works on a model that describes a natural biochemical pathway.},

abstract = {Complex systems such as glasses, gels, granular materials, and systems far from equilibrium exhibit violation of the ergodic hypothesis (EH) and of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). Recent investigations in systems with memory have established a hierarchical connection between mixing, the EH and the FDT. They have shown that a failure of the mixing condition (MC) will lead to the subsequent failures of the EH and of the FDT. Another important point is that such violations are not limited to complex systems: simple systems may also display this feature. Results from such systems are analytical and obviously easier to understand than those obtained in complex structures, where a large number of competing phenomena are present. In this work, we review some important requirements for the validity of the FDT and its connection with mixing, the EH and anomalous diffusion in one-dimensional systems. We show that when the FDT fails, an out-of-equilibrium system relaxes to an effective temperature different from that of the heat reservoir. This effective temperature is a signature of metastability found in many complex systems such as spin-glasses and granular materials.},

abstract = {We study the Lagrangian dynamics of systems of N point vortices and passive particles in a two-dimensional, doubly periodic domain. The probability distribution function of vortex velocity, p{\_}N, has a slow-velocity Gaussian component and a significant high-velocity tail caused by close vortex pairs. In the limit for N -{\textgreater} oo, p{\_}N tends to a Gaussian. However, the form of the single-vortex velocity causes very slow convergence with N; for N {\~{}} 10{\^{}}6 the non-Gaussian high-velocity tails still play a significant role. At finite N, the Gaussian component is well modeled by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process with variance sigma{\_}N = sqrt{\{}N ln N /2 pi{\}}. Considering in detail the case N=100, we show that at short times the velocity autocorrelation is dominated by the Gaussian component and displays an exponential decay with a short Lagrangian decorrelation time. The close pairs have a long correlation time and cause nonergodicity over at least the time of the integration. Due to close vortex dipoles the absolute dispersion differs significantly from the OU prediction, and shows evidence of long-time anomalous dispersion. We discuss the mathematical form of a new stochastic model for the Lagrangian dynamics, consisting of an OU model combined with long-lived close same-sign vortices engaged in rapid rotation and long-lived close dipoles engaged in ballistic motion. From a dynamical-systems perspective this work indicates that systems of dimension O(100) can have behavior which is a combination of both low-dimensional behavior, i.e. close pairs, and extremely high-dimensional behavior described by traditional stochastic processes.},

abstract = {Nonequilibrium physics encompasses a broad range of natural and synthetic small-scale systems. Optimizing transitions of such systems will be crucial for the development of nanoscale technologies and may reveal the physical principles underlying biological processes at the molecular level. Recent work has demonstrated that when a thermodynamic system is driven away from equilibrium then the space of controllable parameters has a Riemannian geometry induced by a generalized inverse diffusion tensor. We derive a simple, compact expression for the inverse diffusion tensor that depends solely on equilibrium information for a broad class of potentials. We use this formula to compute the minimal dissipation for two model systems relevant to small-scale information processing and biological molecular motors. In the first model, we optimally erase a single classical bit of information modelled by an overdamped particle in a smooth double-well potential. In the second model, we find the minimal dissipation of a simple molecular motor model coupled to an optical trap. In both models, we find that the minimal dissipation for the optimal protocol of duration $\tau$ is proportional to 1/$\tau$ , as expected, though the dissipation for the erasure model takes a different form than what we found previously for a similar system.},

Recent work has shown that when a thermodynamic system is driven from equilibrium then, in the linear response regime, the space of controllable parameters has a Riemannian geometry induced by a generalized friction tensor. We exploit this geometric insight to construct closed-form expressions for minimal-dissipation protocols for a particle diffusing in a one-dimensional harmonic potential, where the spring constant, inverse temperature, and trap location are adjusted simultaneously. These optimal protocols are geodesics on the Riemannian manifold and reveal that this simple model has a surprisingly rich geometry. We test these optimal protocols via a numerical implementation of the Fokker-Planck equation and demonstrate that the friction tensor arises naturally from a first-order expansion in temporal derivatives of the control parameters, without appealing directly to linear response theory.},
